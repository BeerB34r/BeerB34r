hi, i am currently attending [Codam](https://www.codam.nl/en), part of the [42
network](https://www.42.fr), where i am writing a bunch of c and sh, with some c++ sprinkled in

if you think i'd fit in at your company, i am open to employment ;)

### stuff im doing
most of my work at Codam is available in the multitude of public repositories i
have. of the projects i have currently completed, i would recommend checking out
my [born2beroot](https://www.github.com/BeerB34r/born2beroot) as i did it in a
pretty unusual way. you can find all of them consolidated in one place
[here](https://www.github.com/BeerB34r/codam-core), though i am notoriously bad
at keeping the submodules up to date :pensive:

my current codam project is MiniRT

### stuff i enjoy
i like ttrpgs, video games and the high medieval period. i'm particularly fond
of [motw](https://evilhat.com/product/monster-of-the-week),
[balatro](https://www.playbalatro.com) and the politics of european guilds, to
name one of each.

one of my favourite things to do is be silly with [shell
scripts](https://www.github.com/BeerB34r/treachery), and doing even more, tiny changes to my
[dotfiles](https://www.github.com/BeerB34r/dotfiles)

### stuff i dont enjoy
i dislike using AI in general, and am pretty fervently opposed to all
implementations of the blockchain i've seen over the years. web3 is decidedly
_not_ my jam.

hi, i am currently attending [Codam](https://www.codam.nl/en), part of the [42
network](https://www.42.fr), where i am writing a bunch of c and sh, with c++ on
the horizon

i like ttrpgs, video games and the high medieval period. i'm particularly fond
of [motw](https://evilhat.com/product/monster-of-the-week),
[balatro](https://www.playbalatro.com) and the politics of european guilds, to
name one of each.
one of my favourite things to do is be silly with [shell
scripts](https://www.github.com/BeerB34r/treachery), and doing even more, tiny changes to my
[dotfiles](https://www.github.com/BeerB34r/dotfiles)
